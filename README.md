# HackZone 
It's a blog for new hackers.


## Introduction
Hi, the world! 

I'm an enthusiastic hacker about machine learning and software development. Although starting from as a biology student as a undergrad, I managed to go to Carnegie Mellon University, School of Computer Science for graduate study. Along the way, so many people generously helped me and expand my understanding of the modern computation and machine learning. Among those, I found learning through online blog posts is one of the most effective way to grab knowledge from absolutely knowing nothing to some confident level about the subject. 


Therefore, this blog is about sharing knowledge in computer science and machine learning I've learnt so far. And also it serves as a documentation of my learning at CMU for either doing research or taking classes. Hopefully it can help someone who's just starting to learn CS and ML and also deepen my understanding of what I learnt as well.
